Probability Density Function (PDF) for continuous random variable definition:
    - Probability Density Function gives us the probability of data point falling within some give range of
        value occurring.
    - The reason is because in normal distribution is using continuous data distribution, which means
      there are infinite numbers. It never gets to 0.0. It gets to 0.01, 0.0001, 0.0000001 something like this.
    - So in this case, if we don't assign the specific range, we can't get the value.
    - Simple example, what percent of possibility in between mean and a standard deviation (it is a range)?

Probability Mass Function (PMF) with discrete random variable:
    - The discrete data: not continuous data. Each variable is not related to each other.
    - So we do not think normal distribution in this case.

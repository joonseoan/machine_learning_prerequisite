- Major types of Data
  . Numerical:
        Quantitative measurement
        (discrete data: countable, continuous data: not countable and also can be infinite)
  . Categorical:
        Quantitative data that has no inherent mathematical meaning
        (Gender, y/n, Race, State of Residence, Product Category, etc.)
        We can assign numbers to categorical data in order to represent them more compactly,
        but the numbers don't have *** mathematical meaning ***
  . Ordinal:
        A mixture of numerical and categorical data
        In this environment, the categorical data has mathematical meaning.
        (For instance, movie rating on a 1 - 5 scale. these values have mathematical meaning: 1 means the worst)

 - Mean, Median, and Mode
    . Mean: AKA Average
    . Median: *** Sort values ***, and take the value at the midpoint
        If we have an even number of samples, take the average of the two in the middle.
    . Mode: the most common value in a data set (Not related to continuous numerical data)
        [0, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0] ==>  0 is mode
    . When there is no common element, it returns a minimum value

 - Variance and Standard Deviation
    . Variance measures how "spread-out" the data is.
    . Variance is simply the average of the `squared` differences from the mean
    . Example) What is the variance of the data set (1, 4, 5, 4, 8)?
        - Mean: (1 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 8) / 5 = 4.4
        - Find the difference from the mean: (-3.4, -0.4, 0.6, -0.4, 3.6)  ==> it should be like 1 - 4.4, 4 - 4.4...
        - Find the squared differences: (11.56, 0.16, 0.36, 0.16, 12.96) ===> no negative number
          . We should make sure that negative variances count just as much as positive variance
            Otherwise, we would cancel each other out
          . Also, we might want to give more weight to the outliers: In statistics,
            an outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations.
            An outlier may be due to a variability in the measurement, an indication of novel data, or it may be
            the result of experimental error. So the squared difference amplifies the effect of things are very different
            from the mean.
        - Find the average of the squared differences: (11.56 + 0.16 + 0.36 + 0.16 + 12.96) / 5 = 5.04

    . Standard Deviation is just the square root of the variance
    . a = /5.04 = 2.24
    . So the standard deviation of (1, 4, 5, 4, 8) is 2.24
    . This is usually used as a way to identify outliers. Data points that lie more than one standard deviation
      from the mean can be considered unusual.
    . For instance, the outside data of 4.4 - 2.24 ~  4.4 + 2.24 are outliers.

 - Working with the sample data
    . Let's say it is the variance of the entire data set: (11.56 + 0.16 + 0.36 + 0.16 + 12.96) / 5 = 5.04
    . If we want to use sample data, we just need to divide the squared variances by "N - 1"
      : (11.56 + 0.16 + 0.36 + 0.16 + 12.96) / 4 = 6.3

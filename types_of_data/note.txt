- Major types of Data
  . Numerical:
        Quantitative measurement
        (discrete data: countable, continuous data: not countable and also can be infinite)
  . Categorical:
        Quantitative data that has no inherent mathematical meaning
        (Gender, y/n, Race, State of Residence, Product Category, etc.)
        We can assign numbers to categorical data in order to represent them more compactly,
        but the numbers don't have *** mathematical meaning ***
  . Ordinal:
        A mixture of numerical and categorical data
        In this environment, the categorical data has mathematical meaning.
        (For instance, movie rating on a 1 - 5 scale. these values have mathematical meaning: 1 means the worst)

 - Mean, Median, and Mode
    . Mean: AKA Average
    . Median: *** Sort values ***, and take the value at the midpoint
        If we have an even number of samples, take the average of the two in the middle.
    . Mode: the most common value in a data set (Not related to continuous numerical data)
        [0, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0] ==>  0 is mode
    . When there is no common element, it returns a minimum value
